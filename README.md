## üìä **Project Overview**

Welcome to my **Flight Booking Price Prediction** project! As a **Data Analyst**, I have worked on predicting flight ticket prices using historical data and various features. This project applies **machine learning techniques**, including **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, feature engineering, and model evaluation, to predict flight prices.

Through thorough **data analysis**, I aimed to uncover valuable insights from the dataset and build a robust prediction model. This project is a perfect blend of data analysis and predictive modeling, demonstrating how data can lead to actionable insights.

## üìã **Dataset Information**

The dataset consists of **around 300,000 records** with **11 columns** that I used to train my models. The data captures different attributes of flight bookings:

- **Airline**: The name of the airline company.
- **Flight**: Flight code.
- **Source City**: The city where the flight departs from.
- **Departure Time**: Time when the flight departs.
- **Stops**: The number of stops between the source and destination cities.
- **Arrival Time**: Time when the flight arrives.
- **Destination City**: The city where the flight lands.
- **Class**: Seat class (Economy, Business).
- **Duration**: Time taken for the journey in hours.
- **Days Left**: The number of days left before the flight departs.
- **Price**: The target variable - the ticket price.

## üíª **Usage**

### **Steps to Run the Project**:

1. **Preprocess the Data**:  
   Run the script to clean and preprocess the data.
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    ```

2. **Train the Models**:  
   Train machine learning models for price prediction, such as **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**.
    ```bash
    python src/model_training.py
    ```

3. **Evaluate the Models**:  
   Evaluate the model performance using **RMSE**, **MAPE**, and **R¬≤** metrics.
    ```bash
    python src/model_evaluation.py
    ```

4. **Interactive Analysis**:  
   For exploratory analysis, you can open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    notebooks/flight_price_prediction.ipynb
    ```

## üîç **Model Evaluation**

I used various performance metrics to evaluate the model predictions:

| **Model**              | **RMSE**   | **MAPE**  |
|------------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Linear Regression**   | 7259.93    | 34%       |
| **Decision Tree**       | 3620       | 7.7%      |
| **Random Forest**       | 2824       | 7.3%      |

### **Key Insights**:
- **Linear Regression** performed poorly with a high RMSE of **7259.93** and MAPE of **34%**.
- **Decision Tree** outperformed Linear Regression with an RMSE of **3620** and MAPE of **7.7%**.
- **Random Forest** showed the best performance with the lowest RMSE (**2824**) and MAPE (**7.3%**).

## üöÄ **Project Workflow**

### **1. Importing Libraries**  
The first step in the project is to import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualizations, and machine learning.

### **2. Loading the Data**  
I loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and performed basic data inspection and cleaning. I removed unnecessary columns and handled missing values.

### **3. Data Preprocessing**  
- **Handling Missing Values**: I checked for missing values and cleaned them appropriately.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Categorical variables like **Airline**, **Source City**, etc., were one-hot encoded for model training.

### **4. Data Visualization**  
- **Price vs Airline**: I visualized the price distribution across different airlines.
- **Price vs Days Left**: I explored how the flight price is related to the number of days left for departure.
- **Ticket Price Range**: A visualization of ticket prices across all flights.
- **Class-wise Price Range**: A comparison of ticket prices between **Economy** and **Business** class.

### **5. Feature Selection**  
- **Correlation Heatmap**: I generated a heatmap to explore correlations between features and the target variable (Price).
- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: I used VIF to identify multicollinearity in features and dropped the **Stops** column due to high VIF.

### **6. Machine Learning Models**  
I trained three models to predict flight prices:
- **Linear Regression**: A basic model for prediction.
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: A more advanced model for better accuracy.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method that performed the best in this case.
